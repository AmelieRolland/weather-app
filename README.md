## THE PROJECT

This is a project-test for a school I would really love to integrate. This was very challenging since I made it before my JS class, so basically I had to learn a lot of things by myself.

There is a big JS community on internet so I could find most solutions to my problematics, therefore, I couldn't install node-cron, maybe because of the node version. I even tried an other one, 'cron', but it wasn't successfull either.

Also, since I trained myself, maybe I used some methods, or functions that are not the most optimized; I'm sure I will learn more soon and change it when needed.



## Installation

I have forked this project then cloned it; I had some struggles about the node versioning,
and I had to install nvm so I can switch the node version (16 needed here).

## What I will do next

I definitelly want to find a solution for node-cron; and maybe add some more features, changing decor when day or night, it could be really fun.
