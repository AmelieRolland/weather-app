## THE PROJECT

This is a project-test for a school I would really love to integrate. This was very challenging since I made it before my JS class, so basically I had to learn a lot of things by myself.

They asked me to change the api they were using (weathermeteo) and use openmeteo, with some new requests. This is the first time I worked with existing code, it was very interesting.

There is a big JS community on internet so I could find most solutions to my problematics.

Still, I integrate a real time clock, but I couldn't find a way to make it use the timezone... So, so far, apparently I can use it only in France (metropolitain) ; if I set a different city abroad it won't change the time. (I found out that when I use the data, the setInterval won't work as it should.) I will work on this.

> [!NOTE]
> **UPDATE** I finally found a way to add the timezone with a function! ðŸŽ‰

I added a file, in Services, where I made a function to change the main image + description acording to the weather code.

Also, since I trained myself, maybe I used some methods, or functions that are not the most optimized; I'm sure I will learn more soon and change it when needed.



## Installation

I have forked this project then cloned it; I had some struggles about the node version,
and I had to use nvm so I can switch the node version (16 needed here).

## What I will do next

I would love to add some more features, changing decor when day or night for exemple, it could be really fun.
Plus definitely I will work on the optimization of all the functions and methods with maybe some librairies I will find!
